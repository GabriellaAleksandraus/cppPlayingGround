## C++
C++ follows a simple standard. You only pay for what you use. This means that it is not as simple as languges like Python since you need to specify all the components you want to use.

A C++ program needs to first be compiled. Compiled means that the program is translated from text to machine code which is unreadable to a human eye but highly efficient to exicute. You compile the code using g++ which is a GNU GCC compiler for C and C++. The compiler produces a executable file that you can run. The entry point for C++ is function named.
